						Notable correlations include High school completion vs. Health, 
						Disability employment vs. Costly doctor visits, 
						White-collar jobs vs. Obesity, and Poverty vs. Health. 
						Overall, data correlates as expected, with more high school completion, 
						less poverty, greater disability employment, and more white-collar jobs
						tending toward better health, less financial strife with respect to doctors,
						and lower obesity rates.
