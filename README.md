### [View the Dashboard Here](https://khmccurdy.github.io/us_census_d3)

The purpose of this project was to compare demographic and health data by state using data from the 2014 US Census. Data was selected from the [US Census](https://factfinder.census.gov) and [CDC Behavioral Risk Factor](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/) websites, cleaned using Excel, and saved in CSV format. The CSV was then used to drive an interactive scatterplot, with multiple axis selection, using D3.
